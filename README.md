This is a repo showcasing different types of imports using __init__.py

There are a few scripts with functions named no.1-6 and I have tested importing this:
    - Within a script called main.py within the "Application" directory
    - Within function_imports.py outside of the "Application" directory

I have also experimented with how to run unittests on these functions using the tests
stored within tests_folders/test_functions.py using imports

There is an example command within unittest script that has to be typed into the command line
while in the "Application" directory 
(E.g., says user@computer:~/unittest_and_import_structure/Application$ in command line)
however the tests can also be run if the package is installed within a conda environment.
