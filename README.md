This is a repo showcasing different types of imports using \_\_init\_\_.py and getting
unit testing to work using these imports / pyproject.toml

There are a few scripts with functions named no.1-6 at different depths in the 
"Application" directory to show \_\_init\_\_.py setups

There are two scripts which show importing using \_\_init\_\_.py which can be run:\n
    1 - Within a script called main.py within the "Application" directory \n
    2 - Within function_imports.py outside of the "Application" directory

__These are the only 2 runnable scripts in this repo!__

I have also experimented with how to run unit tests on these functions using the tests
stored within "tests/" using imports

Within "tests/" there are two scripts, one if you dont have pyproject.toml set up and
another with pyproject.toml set up

Each script talks in detail for how to get the unit tests to run so hopefully this is helpful


TLDR: if you're interested in \_\_init\_\_.py read each \_\_init\_\_.py and scripts. \n
      if you're interested in getting unit testing set up read the unit test scripts
